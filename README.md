Encryption_Importer

My code is probably wrong, but the idea that I wanted to do was to have the ability to automatically import encryption keys into your system without going through an additional program. And if they were not present, to download the key into the system. But want to make sure there is strict security, before importing the encryption keys. Want this to work in Windows systems as well. I have 2 versions in there, same file just written in a slightly different many, not sure which way is the correct way.
